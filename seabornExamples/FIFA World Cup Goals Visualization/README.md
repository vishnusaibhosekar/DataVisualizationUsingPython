# FIFA World Cup Goals Visualization

For this project I explored data from the Fifa World Cup from 1930-2014 to analyze trends and discover insights about the world’s game, fútbol!

This Fifa World Cup data is from Kaggle.

Using Seaborn I created a series of plots that explore aggregates and distribution across the goals scored in World Cup games.
